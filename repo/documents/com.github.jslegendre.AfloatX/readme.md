### Although AfloatX has some of the same features as Afloat, it is not meant to be a clone. 

**AfloatX** is a simple and unobtrusive plugin made to give you some additional window management features.  
Current features are: 

- Keep window on top (floating window)
- Keep window on behind all other windows
- Transient mode: Always come to focus in current space. Won't force you back to that windows last active space
- Sticky mode: Window stays visible on all spaces
- Invert window color
- Click-Through window: Window is invisible to clicks (best paired with a floating window)
- Outline Window: Outline window with 1 of 8 colors
- Window transparency
